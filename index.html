<h3>Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p>Yeh jawaani hai deewani is truly a treat to watch.Such a masterpiece. The joy that runs through you mind when you enjoy golden days with your best friends.when you don't know interacting with people still someone comes to your life,changes the rhythm,makes you fall in love with the most unexpected person and of course yourself too.6 years passed still the love and craze is same! it's insanely beautiful.A worth watching movie for all ages. But amidst all of these, i love naina the most. All the girls going out, chilling are not just the best,sometimes some stories remains untold and just being incapable of expressing. Ever girl is beautiful in their own ways. I love deepika's character in YJHD. Honestly, love for this movies never went and will never go. I have literally watched this movie more than 15 times. The way i watched it in 2013,the same vibe in 2019. i never get bored. Witnessed love,friendship, career and a better way to lead life. it's my favourite movie and will be always!!!!!</p>

<h3>Sita Ramam</h3>
<p>Film is soo well written in a layer of screenplay it unfolds and takes you on a magical journey of Sita & Ram , their life , their identity , their own struggles everything so well stitched in the screenplay . Dulquer Salman is soo amazing as Ram , he has played his role with soo much conviction , for me the soul and highlight of the film is Mrunal Thakur who is pretty in every frame and not just that she has aced the role of Sita with utmost excellence & innocence, emotions were soo beautifully & naturally infused in her acting , you feel for her , you will just love the way she has portrayed her role may it be her grace ,acting, dance or emotional scenes , she was soo soo graceful as the princess,no one could do it better than her . The chemistry between lead pair Dulquer Salman & Mrunal feels soo realistic and convincing , the romantic scenes portrayed core emotions and bond between the lead pairs which made it feel more raw & real , it makes you get into the story of Sita & Ram . Rashmika Mandana has also been good . Really love the writing of this movie , its rare to see such kind of writing , no where do you feel like its stretched or exaggerated it just goes in a flow , Cinematography is just woow , BGM makes it even more magical . Dialogues were good . Kudos to the director for handling such a layered script in a smooth flow keeping audience engaged . Climax will just touch your hearts in the deepest way possible and make you teary eyed , you will feel the emotions to the core , this film is a extraordinary love story seen the recent times. Totally worth it , such a beautiful film . </p>
